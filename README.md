# AutoMute

Have you been stared by others when your phone is ringing in a meeting or classroom? 

Try this, **AutoMute** provides an easy way which automatically silent the phone to avoid such embarrass. 

The current version supports the following two types of configuration:
- Mute the phone in a specific range of time. For example if you sleep between 11PM and 8AM, you can add this scenario and your phone will be automatically muted from 11PM to 8AM.
- Mute the phone in a repeated range of time. For example if you have to work between 9AM to 5PM every workday. You can add a repeated muter and your phone will be automatically muted from 9AM to 5PM every workday.

Before using this library I recommend that you check out the new Google Material Guidelines.Don't over cardify your UI.
